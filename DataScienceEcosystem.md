### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.



```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result

```




    17




```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours

```
